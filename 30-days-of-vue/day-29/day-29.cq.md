# Vue 3.0 and the future of Vue

> In today's article, we'll take a brief look at some of the cool features Vue 3.0 is expected to bring when it arrives.

Everything weâ€™ve discussed within this course covers the latest current release of Vue, often labeled as [version 2.x](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/releases).

In [Sept. 2016](https://medium.com/the-vue-point/vue-2-0-is-here-ef1f26acf4b8), the Vue framework was rewritten and released as version 2.0. Vue 2.0 introduced new concepts such as a lightweight virtual DOM implementation, render functions, and server-side rendering capabilities. In addition, version 2.0 was rewritten to provide significant performance improvements over version 1.x.

Exactly two years later, Evan You published [Plans for the Next Iteration of Vue.js](https://medium.com/the-vue-point/plans-for-the-next-iteration-of-vue-js-777ffea6fabf), an article that summarizes a talk he gave at [Vue.js London](https://vuejs.london/summary/) presenting a sneak peek of whatâ€™s coming in the upcoming Vue release. At November 15th, 2018 and as the keynote speaker of [VueConfTO](https://vuetoronto.com/schedule/) - Evan took a deeper dive to explain some of the features Vue 3.0 would bring.

The Plans for the Next Iteration of Vue.js article and Evanâ€™s [slides from VueConf TO](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yhPGyhQrJcpJI2ZFvBme3pGKaGNiLi709c37svivv0o/edit) are both stellar in their explanations. As a result, we wonâ€™t be going into _too much detail_ in this article but will summarize some of the cool updates coming with Vue 3.0!

## Vue 3.0

### Breaking changes

Though Vue 3.0 _will have_ some breaking changes, the good news is that the Vue API will largely either remain the same or have a clear compatibility build with Vue 2.x. [Scoped slots](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-slots.html#Scoped-Slots) and the [native JavaScript process of writing `render()` functions](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/render-function.html#Basics) are to experience some significant changes.

### Virtual DOM re-write (with TypeScript!)

The core Virtual DOM source code implementation is getting a complete re-write with TypeScript! The Virtual DOM implementation is being re-written to achieve 100% faster mounting and patching which supports one of the main goals of making the Vue library _even faster then it is right now_.

The source code has moved away from using [Flow](https://flow.org/) to now instead use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as the main types interface. __This doesn't mean we will have to use TypeScript with Vue__ but it does pave the way for improved TypeScript support in Vue 3.0!

I> TypeScript will be a prerequisite if you're interested in contributing to the Vue 3.0 source code directly ðŸ˜›.

### IE11 Support

Vue 3.0 is to adapt a __Proxy based observation mechanism__ for the detection and observation to changes within Vue instances. This is great because now, some of the caveats weâ€™ve mentioned in this course like the inability to add/delete new properties in an instance or directly mutate data arrays will no longer be a problem in Vue 3.0!

Since Proxy based observations arenâ€™t compatible and canâ€™t be transpiled for IE11, a separate build will be available for developers building for IE11. This particular build will default to Vue 2.xâ€™s `Object.defineProperty` API to detect Vue instance changes - which would result in having the same detection caveats that currently exist.

### Class Based Components

Class based components (which we havenâ€™t really discussed in this course) will be getting first class support in Vue 3.0!

Class based components will involve using the ES6 class syntax to create a component instance. Here's an example of a class-based component, called `Hello`, that Evan originally displayed in his Vue 3.0 Updates presentation:

```javascript
interface HelloProps {
  text: string
}

class Hello extends Component<HelloProps> {
  count = 0
  render() {
    return <div>
      {this.count}
      {this.$props.text}
    </div>
  }
}
```

The `Hello` component above is constructed with the `class` syntax and extends a `Component` keyword. The component uses the `render()` function with JSX to create the markup of the component.

Some people prefer using the class-based syntax to construct components due to improved TypeScript declaration and having components be written in a more concise manner.

Though potentially different to what Vue 3.0 would bring: you can try out class-based components in Vue 2.x by scaffolding a Vue CLI project, selecting the Typescript feature, and answering â€˜Yesâ€™ to using a class-style component syntax. This will scaffold the project and allow the declaration of class components with the help of the  [`vue-class-component`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-class-component) library.

### Exposed reactivity API

Vue 3.0 aims to _expose_ the reactivity observable API to allow developers to handle simple cross-component state management. Hereâ€™s a code snippet that Evan also shared in the Vue 3.0 Updates presentation that shows an example of how an observable/effect pattern can be pulled and directly used:

```javascript
import { observable, effect } from 'vue'

const state = observable({
 count: 0
})

effect(() => {
 console.log(`count is: ${state.count}`)
}) // count is: 0

state.count++ // count is: 1
```

In the example above, the `observable` and `effect` constructors are imported directly from the Vue library. A `state` object is created and set to an `observable` constructor that wraps an object containing a `count` variable set to 0. The `effect` constructor declares a call back function that has access to and console logs the `state.count` value. Whenever `state.count` is ever changed, the `effect` callback function runs!

Though this is a brief example, this shows us that having direct access to the exposed reactivity API could open the doors to allowing components share information in a really easy way!

## Conclusion

What weâ€™ve talked about thus far are only some of the things that are in the pipeline with what Vue 3.0 is expected to bring. There are a whole slew of more advanced core changes being done to the library such as Static Tree Hoisting, Optimized Slots Generations, Monomorphic Calls, etc. to help achieve the goals of having a _smaller_, _more manageable_, and _faster_ library.

The Vue team has mentioned that there are to be a series of steps in the coming year such as the Public Feedback via RFCs stage, Alpha Phase, and Beta Phase, before the library is launched. If youâ€™re interested, keep your eyes peeled for these phases and be sure to read and check out the following links for more details:

Now when _exactly_ is Vue 3.0 expected to launch? We know that itâ€™ll be within sometime next year.

Though when exactly in the year is still a little too soon to say, weâ€™ll be here to keep you up to date when it happens! Weâ€™ll see you tomorrow for the very last day of the course!
